  making it easier to track changes and perform data audits.
  * **Change Data Capture:** Iceberg can capture changes to your data as they occur, 
  making it easier to build real-time data pipelines and applications.
  * **Schema Evolution:** Iceberg supports schema evolution, allowing you to add or remove columns from your tables without disrupting existing queries.
  * **Performance:** Iceberg is designed for high performance, especially when dealing with large datasets.
  * **Integration:** Iceberg integrates well with many popular data processing and analytics tools.

### Analytics

* **SQL Queries:**
  * **Why:** A powerful language for querying and analyzing structured data.
  * **When:** Use for most analytical tasks, including aggregations, window functions, and joins.
  * **Example tools:** Most data warehouses and databases support SQL (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL).
* **BI Tools:**
  * **Why:** Provide visualization and reporting capabilities for easy data exploration and sharing.
  * **When:** Use for creating dashboards, generating reports, and communicating insights to stakeholders.
  * **Example tools:** Tableau, Looker, Power BI


### Scalability

* **Serverless Architecture:**
  * **Why:** Automates scaling based on workload, reducing operational overhead.
  * **When:** Use for data processing tasks that have variable workloads or when you want to avoid managing infrastructure.
* **Data Lake:**
  * **Why:** Provides flexible storage for unstructured or semi-structured data.
  * **When:** Use for storing raw data, historical data, or data with unknown schemas.
* **Partitioning and Indexing:**
  * **Why:** Improve query performance by organizing data efficiently.
  * **When:** Partition data by frequently queried dimensions and create indexes on frequently accessed columns.


## Adapting the System Design for Near-Real-Time Processing

If **near-real-time data processing** is required, we need to adjust the architecture to _**minimize latency**_.

### Data Ingestion

* **Streaming Platforms:** Use streaming platforms like Apache Kafka or Amazon Kinesis to ingest data in real-time.

### Data Processing

* **Streaming Analytics:** Utilize streaming analytics engines like Apache Flink or Apache Spark Streaming for real-time processing.
* **Micro-batching:** Consider micro-batching for near-real-time processing, where data is processed in small batches.

### Data Storage

* **Time Series Databases:** Use time series databases like InfluxDB or TimescaleDB for efficient storage and querying of time-stamped data.
* **In-Memory Caches:** For extremely low-latency requirements, explore using in-memory caches like Redis or Memcached.

### Analytics

* **Real-time Analytics:** Use real-time analytics tools like Apache Druid to query and visualize data as it arrives.

### Scalability

* **Serverless Architecture:** Leverage serverless functions for scalable and efficient real-time processing.
* **Auto-scaling:** Configure auto-scaling mechanisms to adjust resources based on workload.


### Additional Considerations:

* **Event Sourcing:** Consider using event sourcing to store a sequence of events that represent the state of the data, 
allowing for replay and historical analysis.
* **Change Data Capture (CDC):** Use CDC to capture changes to data sources in real-time 
and propagate them to the streaming platform.
* **Latency Optimization:** Optimize network latency, 
data serialization/deserialization, and query performance to minimize processing time.

By incorporating these changes, the system can be adapted to meet near-real-time requirements 
while maintaining scalability and reliability.


## Possible additional questions

### Data Ingestion

* **File Formats:** How would you handle different file formats (e.g., CSV, JSON, XML) within the same pipeline?
  * Require manual specification along with file or during setup
  * Automatic detection, custom code perhaps?

### Data Processing

* **ETL vs. ELT:** Why did you choose ETL (or ELT) for this use case? What are the trade-offs between the two approaches?
  * For this use case, ETL is a suitable choice due to the need for data cleaning, transformation, 
  and validation before loading data into the warehouse.
    * Data complexity and transformation requirements: If you have complex transformations to apply to the data, ETL might be a better choice as it provides more control over the process. 
    * Data quality concerns: If data quality is a critical concern and you need to ensure data integrity before loading, 
    ETL can be useful for implementing validation and cleaning steps. 
    * Target system capabilities: If the target system (e.g., data warehouse) has built-in transformation capabilities, 
    ELT can be a simpler approach. 
    * Scalability: ELT can be more scalable for large datasets, as it can offload data transformation to the target system. 
    * Performance: ETL can introduce additional overhead for data transformation, which might impact performance.
* **Data Quality:** How would you ensure data quality during the transformation process, 
especially for handling missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers?
  * Data Observability Tools like Monte Carlo: Analyze data to identify data quality issues and understand data characteristics.
    * Freshness: Is data up-to-date?
    * Volume: Completeness of data
    * Quality: Values of fields
    * Schema changes
    * Lineage: Upstream and downstream data consumers
* **Schema Evolution:** How would you handle changes to the data schema over time?
  * Monitoring and alerting: Data observability tools
  * Data warehouse tools support schema changes
  * Perhaps a nosql database is a better choice if the data is very unstructured

### Data Storage

* **Data Warehouse vs. Data Lake:** Could you elaborate on the decision to use a data warehouse or a data lake (or both)? 
What factors influenced your choice?
  * A data warehouse is a good choice for this use case due to the structured nature of the data and the need for frequent analytical queries.
* **Partitioning Strategy:** How would you determine the optimal partitioning strategy for the data? What factors would you consider?
  * Partition the data by date or other relevant dimensions to optimize query performance.
